## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################
## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile = "./parameters.txt"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "./arena"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
trainInstancesDir = "/home/moises_silva/ycsb-0.17.0/workloads"

## File that contains a list of training instances and optionally
## additional parameters for them. If trainInstancesDir is provided, irace
## will search for the files in this folder.
trainInstancesFile = "./instances-list.txt"

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of targetRunner) that will performed. It
## determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning.
maxExperiments = 500

## Script called for each configuration that executes the target algorithm
## to be tuned. See templates.
# targetRunner = ""

## File that contains a set of initial configurations. If empty or NULL,
## all initial configurations are randomly generated.
#configurationsFile = "./configurations.txt"

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 2

## Directory where testing instances are located, either absolute or
## relative to current directory.
testInstancesDir = "/home/moises_silva/ycsb-0.17.0/workloads"

## File containing a list of test instances and optionally additional
## parameters for them.
testInstancesFile = "./instances-test-list.txt"

## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.
# debugLevel = 0

## Minimum number of configurations needed to continue the execution of
## each race (iteration).
#minNbSurvival = 1

## File that contains a list of logical expressions that cannot be TRUE
## for any evaluated configuration. If empty or NULL, do not use forbidden
## expressions.
#forbiddenFile = "forbidden.txt"
